Hi, I'm Sean Geiger.

I started Tarsier Technologies to provide technical consulting and freelance engineering.

I spent four years at Apple working on communication technologies, building encrypted messaging systems that scaled to billions of users.  I've also shipped dating apps, built ed-tech sales platforms, and led product development at startups.  I'm lucky to know many talented developers and creatives to help out with projects, and I'd love to hear about interesting opportunities of any size.

*   **Building something on the bleeding edge?**  I can help you adopt and implement new technologies and connect you with industry experts. 
*   **Dealing with challenges as you scale?** Let me help you solve your technical pain points and provide a fantastic experience for your users.
*   **Growing your startup?** I can help you hire a fantastic team and raise capital with the best terms possible.
